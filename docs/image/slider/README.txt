HERO BACKGROUND IMAGES INSTRUCTIONS

The hero section now uses a full-width background image with a blur effect. The background image changes when the slider changes.

Required image files:
1. slider_1.jpg - First slide background
2. slider-12.jpg - Second slide background
3. slider_3.jpg - Third slide background

Image recommendations:
- Use high-quality, high-resolution images (recommended minimum: 1920x1080px)
- Choose images that work well with text overlaid on them
- Dark or muted images work best with the overlay and blur effect
- Ensure the images are optimized for web to maintain fast loading times

Note: The same images are used for both the slider and the background. The background has a dark overlay and blur effect applied to it.

If you need to change the image filenames, update both:
1. The src attributes in index.html
2. The backgroundImages array in js/slider.js
